# Chelcea Claudiu-Marian

The program starts with the creation of the command_list constant pointer
which holds all the accepted commands.
Then, the galaxy is created with the dll_create() function.

The most important part of the program is the for loop, which loops for
'input number' times, a number received from the user and then scans and
executes 'input number' commands by getting the whole line, then returning
the command's index in our command_list pointer and, based on that, in a switch
statement, the right function is called.

In the end the memory is released.

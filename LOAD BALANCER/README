This load balancer program uses the consistent hashing method to distribute
requests evenly between all servers.

The main piece, the load balancer consists of a structure which holds
an array of 'server_pointer' structures that compose the hashring and
a matrix of 'server_memory_t' structures, a matrix of dictionaries.

The hashring contains the 'server_pointer' structures, a custom structure
which holds a replica for a server. Therefore in the hashring we will have
three structures of this type for a server, each having the same server_index,
but different server_label.

The servers are actually stored in the dictionary matrix created with the
'server_memory_t' structure, a matrix of key - pair values.

Implementation:
The program starts by opening a file of requests, then enters a loop that
executes each request by calling a certain function corresponding to the
request.

In the end, the memory is released.
